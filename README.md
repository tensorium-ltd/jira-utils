## Configuration

### Environment Variables

All JIRA integration scripts require these environment variables:

```bash
export JIRA_EMAIL="your.email@company.com"
export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your_jira_api_token"
export JIRA_BASE_URL="https://your-company.atlassian.net"
```

#### Obtaining a JIRA API Token

1. Log in to [https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click "Create API token"
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Sprint Reports")
4. Copy the token (you won't be able to see it again)
5. Set it as the `JIRA_API_TOKEN` environment variable

### Project Configuration

Update these constants in the respective scripts as needed:

**JIRA Settings** (in all JIRA scripts):
```javascript
const PROJECT_KEY = 'VER10';           // Your JIRA project key
const CURRENT_SPRINT = 'NH Sprint 31'; // Current sprint name
```

**Excel File Location**:
```javascript
const WORKBOOK_PATH = './data/NH Story Point Plan.xlsx';
```

---

## Excel Plan Structure

The main planning Excel file (`data/NH Story Point Plan.xlsx`) must have the following structure:

### Main Sheet: "Full-Delivery"

#### Required Rows (Column A):
- **Sprint Information Rows**:
  - `Sprint Number` - e.g., 30, 31, 32
  - `Sprint Start Date` - Working day start date
  - `Sprint End Date` - Working day end date
  - `Total Working Days Per Sprint` - Usually 10
  - `Total Committed Story Points Per Sprint` - Target points
  - `Story Points Delivered` - Actual delivered points (updated daily)
  - `BUGS` - Bug fix story points
  - `STABILIZATION` - Stabilization work points
  - `DELIVERED TODAY` - Points completed today (in Column B)
  - `TOTAL PROJECT REMAINING STORY POINTS` - Overall project remaining work

- **Epic Rows** (starting after header rows):
  - Column A: Epic name
  - Columns for each sprint: Story points allocated
  - Row named `TOTALS`: Formula summing all epics
  - Row marker: `IGNORE BELOW` - Anything below this is excluded

#### Special Markers:
- `IGNORE BELOW` - Place this in Column A to mark the end of epic data

### Progress Sheet

Auto-generated by scripts with the following structure:
- **Row 1**: Date headers (working days only)
- **Row 2**: Target Velocity (S-curve distributed)
- **Row 3**: Actual Velocity (daily completed points)
- **Row 4**: Cumulative Committed
- **Row 5**: Cumulative Actual
- **Row 6**: Variance (Actual - Committed)
- **Row 7**: Burndown (Remaining work)

### Designs Sheet (Optional)

For design progress tracking:
- **Column A**: Epic names
- **Column B**: Percentage complete (0-100)

### Individual Sprint Sheets

Auto-generated by `generate-sprint-sheets.js`:
- Sprint metadata (dates, working days, totals)
- Epic-by-epic breakdown
- Daily story point allocation (with S-curve distribution)
- Story Points Delivered row
- Summary calculations

---

## Scripts

### Sprint Planning Scripts

#### 1. `generate-sprint-sheets.js`

Generates individual sprint sheets from the main Excel plan.

- Respects "IGNORE BELOW" marker
- Populates Progress sheet with S-curve target velocity

**Usage**:
```bash
npm run generate-sheets
```

**S-Curve Distribution**:
- Days 1-2: ~15% of total (slow start)
- Days 3-7: ~40% of total (peak productivity)
- Days 8-10: ~15% of total (slow finish)

**Output**: Updates `data/NH Story Point Plan.xlsx` with:
- Individual sprint sheets (e.g., "Sprint 30", "Sprint 31")

🚀 NH UAT Defect Upload to JIRA
============================================================

🔍 Discovering required fields...
   ✓ Found assignee: Caroline Wallen
   ✓ Found fixVersion: Release 1C
   ✓ Found Epic Link field: customfield_11151

📄 Reading CSV file...
   ✓ Found 2 rows in CSV

📝 Processing defects...

⏭️  Skipping test example: Defect 01 - TEST EXAMPLE - ...

🔍 Processing: UAT-PPP-003 - Create Project Button is greyed out
   ✅ Created bug: VER10-9210

============================================================
📊 SUMMARY:
   Total Defects Processed: 2
   ✅ Created: 1
   ⏭️  Skipped: 1 (1 test example, 0 duplicates)
   ❌ Errors: 0

Created Bugs:
   - VER10-9210: UAT-PPP-003 - Create Project Button is greyed out
```

**Duplicate Detection**:
- Searches JIRA by summary text before creating
- If found, logs the existing issue key and skips creation
- Prevents duplicate bug entries from repeated script runs

**CSV Example**:
```csv
Defect Name,Severity / Priority,Module / Area,Defect Description,...
"UAT-001 - Login fails","P1","Authentication","Users cannot log in",...
```

## Troubleshooting

### JIRA API Issues

**Problem**: `401 Unauthorized`
- **Solution**: Check that `JIRA_EMAIL` and `JIRA_API_TOKEN` are correctly set
- Verify the token hasn't expired at https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens

**Problem**: `410 Gone` or `400 Bad Request`
- **Solution**: Scripts use a two-step API approach (fetch keys, then details) to avoid deprecated endpoints

**Problem**: Missing story points
- **Solution**: Scripts default Story and Bug types to 2 points if missing

### Excel File Issues

**Problem**: Formula values showing as `[object Object]`
- **Solution**: Scripts extract `.result` property from formula objects

**Problem**: Wrong epic totals
- **Solution**: Add `IGNORE BELOW` marker to exclude summary/scratch rows

**Problem**: Wrong dates in Progress sheet
- **Solution**: Ensure "Sprint Start Date" and "Sprint End Date" are formatted as dates in Excel

### PDF Generation Issues

**Problem**: Bars going off page
- **Solution**: Scripts auto-scale based on `maxBarWidth` constant

**Problem**: Overlapping text
- **Solution**: Adjust font sizes and spacing in `templates/report-template.js`

---

## Script Customization

### Changing Sprint Names
Update in each JIRA script:
```javascript
const CURRENT_SPRINT = 'NH Sprint 32'; // Change to your sprint name
```

### Changing Status Names
Update status arrays in JIRA scripts:
```javascript
const COMPLETED_STATUSES = ['Ready for release', 'CLOSED', 'Closed', 'Done'];
const IN_QA_STATUS = 'In QA';
const IN_DEV_STATUS = 'In Dev';
```

### Changing S-Curve Profile
Edit in `generate-sprint-sheets.js`:
```javascript
function generateSCurveProfile(totalDays) {
  const profile = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < totalDays; i++) {
    const t = i / (totalDays - 1);
    // Adjust these parameters to change curve shape
    const sigmoid = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-10 * (t - 0.5)));
    profile.push(sigmoid);
  }
  return profile;
}
```

### Changing Story Point Defaults
Update in JIRA scripts:
```javascript
// Current default: 2 points for Stories/Bugs without points
if ((issueType === 'Story' || issueType === 'Bug') && storyPoints === 0) {
  storyPoints = 2; // Change this value
}
```
